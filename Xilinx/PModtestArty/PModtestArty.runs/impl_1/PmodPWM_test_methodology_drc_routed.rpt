2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.397 ns between P1/count_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk) and PWM1 (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.476 ns between P1/count_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk) and PWM2 (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.486 ns between P1/count_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk) and PWM3 (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
