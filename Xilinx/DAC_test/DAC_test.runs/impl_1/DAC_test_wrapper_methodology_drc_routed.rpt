TIMING-8#1 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks VIRTUAL_clk_out2_DAC_test_clk_wiz_0_0 and DAC_test_i/c_counter_binary_0/U0/i_synth/i_baseblox.i_baseblox_counter/THRESH0 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.620 ns between resetn_0 (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_out2_DAC_test_clk_wiz_0_0) and DAC_test_i/SineWave100s_0/U0/count_reg[0]/R (clocked by DAC_test_i/c_counter_binary_0/U0/i_synth/i_baseblox.i_baseblox_counter/THRESH0).
