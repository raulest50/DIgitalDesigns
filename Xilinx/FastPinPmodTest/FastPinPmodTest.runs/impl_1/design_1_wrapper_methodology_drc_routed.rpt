2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.712 ns between design_1_i/PWM_12b_1/inst/count_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and PWM_0 (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.760 ns between design_1_i/PWM_12b_0/inst/count_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and PWM_1 (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
